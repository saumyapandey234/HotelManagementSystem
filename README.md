# HotelManagementSystem
**Hotel Management System** is a desktop-based application developed using **Core Java**, utilizing **AWT** and **Swing** for the user interface and **MySQL** for backend data management. This project is designed to help understand and demonstrate fundamental **Java Core concepts**, including GUI development and database connectivity using JDBC.
## Key Features
- Customer Booking and Check-In
- Room Availability and Room Allotment
- Customer Details Management
- Checkout and Bill Generation
- Room Status Update (Available/Occupied)
- 🛠Admin Login Panel (optional)
- Real-time data interaction with MySQL database

## Set Up MySQL Database
Open MySQL Workbench or any DB tool.
Create a database (e.g., hotel_db).
Import the hotel.sql file to generate required tables.
## Compile and Run the Project
Use any Java IDE like NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ:
## Compile and run the Main.java file.
Ensure MySQL server is running before you start the application.
## Learning Objectives
Practice Core Java OOPs Concepts
Learn GUI Development using AWT and Swing
Understand JDBC and MySQL Integration
Gain hands-on experience in real-world CRUD operations
